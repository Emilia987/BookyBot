# BookyBot
a bot that will check a site for if an appointment is available and send notifications to discord

BookyBot is a simple webscraper that is limited to a single line of text on a website. If change in that line is detected, the bot will send a discord notification. 

I use this for getting a doctors appointment, since the doctors site says "no appointment availbe right now", the bot reads that and when the line disappears, I get notified. To make it fair for everyone and not arrouse suspision, the bot will randomly check the site, once every 7 to 30 minutes, however this can be adjusted.
